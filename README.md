# Client-Server-Chat

I used Python3 to code my Client/Server Chat Portfolio Project for my Intro to Computer Networks class. It implements a fixed
message length of 1024 using a socket. 

1) This program is very simple to execute. Once you run the server, you
can run the client. Once both connections are established, the output
on the server confirms this by stating which host and port it is
connected by.

2) The output on client.py is then prompted to enter input.

3) Once the server receives the client’s message, the server is prompted to reply.

4) This can continue for a whole conversation, then once the client is ready to quit, they can by typing ‘/q’. Once the server is ready to quit, they can by typing ‘/q’ as well.
